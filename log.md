# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 2)

### Day 1: November 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Great start with the first module to the SharePoint Fundamentals.  Developed my first "Hello World" SharePoint Webpart with React.  I also revisited Free Code Camp and studied JavaScript under the Front End Development Certificate.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to continue learning and applying my skills from React to SharePoint.  This will require more study on React and ES6.

### Day 2: November 18, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed more Free Code Camp JavaScript module...alomost done! Read more on SharePoint REST APIs.

**Thoughts:** This is quite a long module, estimated to take 10 hours to complete.  The SharePoint CRUD process will more than likely be used frequently in my new job.

### Day 3: November 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: The Free Code Camp JavaScript module is dooooonnnneee!  Moving on to Object Orientend and Functional Programming next. Started reviewing SQL Database Fundamentals on the Microsoft Virtual Academy.

**Thoughts:** Feeling pretty good about completing the JavaScript but I still have a lot to learn and topics to review as a refresher.

### Day 4: November 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed LeanKit Kanban tutorial and brushed up on SCRUM. Reviewed more of the SharePoint Framework and broke my "Hello World" web part for fun. 

**Thoughts:** Started my new job as a SharePoint Developer today.  My PM asked about REST APIs and I'm so glad I was able to answer his question based on studying the day before.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
